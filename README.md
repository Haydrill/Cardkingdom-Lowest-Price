# Cardkingdom-Lowest-Price
This python project is a tool that allows the input of a Magic: the Gathering card name in the command line, searches for it on Cardkingdom and StarCityGames, and prints the lowest price available on those sites

Disclaimer : I use CardKingdom's price filter, so it might not return the very cheapest version but will return the cheapest version at the highest grade.

As of 6/7/20, I am extending the project to other popular MtG card sites (StarCityGames, TCGPlayer, Channel Fireball). Finished SCG, TCG (hopefully). Currently working on ChannelFireball integration.
